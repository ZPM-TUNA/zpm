## 📋 Setup Checklist for Sponsor Demo

### Quick Setup (30 minutes)

**Option A: Linux Computer**
```bash
# 1. Install ROS2 Humble
sudo apt install ros-humble-desktop

# 2. Create workspace
mkdir -p ~/evacuation_ws/src
cd ~/evacuation_ws/src

# 3. Copy your code
cp -r ~/KnightHacks/backend ~/evacuation_ws/src/evacuation_system/

# 4. Build
cd ~/evacuation_ws
colcon build

# 5. Run
source install/setup.bash
ros2 run evacuation_system pathfinding_node
ros2 run evacuation_system arduino_bridge
```

**Option B: Mac with Docker** (If no Linux available)
```bash
cd ~/Desktop/KnightHacks
docker build -t evacuation-ros2 .
docker run -it --privileged evacuation-ros2
# Inside container, run nodes as above
```

## 🎬 Demo Script for Judges

### Part 1: Show ROS2 Integration (2 minutes)

```bash
# Terminal 1: Launch system
ros2 launch evacuation_system full_system.launch.py

# Terminal 2: Show active ROS2 nodes
ros2 node list
# OUTPUT:
# /evacuation_pathfinding
# /arduino_bridge

# Show topics
ros2 topic list
# OUTPUT:
# /robot/pose
# /robot/obstacle_detected
# /evacuation/path
# /evacuation/maze
# /cmd_vel
```

**Say to Judges:**
> "Our system uses standard ROS2 nodes and topics. Here you can see our pathfinding node and Arduino bridge running with standard ROS2 messages."

---

### Part 2: Demonstrate Obstacle Detection (2 minutes)

```bash
# Terminal 3: Publish obstacle detection
ros2 topic pub /robot/obstacle_detected geometry_msgs/PoseStamped \
  "{header: {frame_id: 'map'}, pose: {position: {x: 1.5, y: 1.0, z: 0.0}}}"

# Watch path recalculation in real-time
ros2 topic echo /evacuation/path
```

**Say to Judges:**
> "When the robot detects an obstacle via the ultrasonic sensor, it publishes to /robot/obstacle_detected. Our pathfinding node automatically recalculates evacuation paths using A* algorithm and publishes the new paths to /evacuation/path."

---

### Part 3: Show in RViz (1 minute)

```bash
# Launch RViz
rviz2

# Add displays:
# - Map: /evacuation/maze
# - Path: /evacuation/path  
# - Pose: /robot/pose
```

**Say to Judges:**
> "Here in RViz, you can see the 8x8 maze grid, the robot's position, detected obstacles, and calculated evacuation paths in real-time."

---

### Part 4: Robot Control (1 minute)

```bash
# Control robot with standard ROS2 /cmd_vel
ros2 topic pub /cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist \
  "{linear: {x: 0.5}, angular: {z: 0.0}}"

# Or high-level commands
ros2 topic pub /robot/execute_command std_msgs/String "{data: 'FORWARD'}"
```

**Say to Judges:**
> "The robot can be controlled via standard ROS2 /cmd_vel topic, making it compatible with the ROS2 navigation stack and other ROS2 tools."

## 🎤 Elevator Pitch for Sponsors

> "Our evacuation system leverages ROS2 to create a dynamic, real-time pathfinding solution. Using ROS2's publish-subscribe architecture, our Arduino robot detects obstacles via ultrasonic sensors, publishes them to standard ROS2 topics, and our pathfinding node recalculates optimal evacuation paths using the A* algorithm. The system is fully integrated with ROS2, using standard message types like `geometry_msgs` and `nav_msgs`, making it compatible with the broader ROS2 ecosystem. We demonstrate real-time obstacle detection, dynamic path recalculation, and visualization in RViz—all running on ROS2 Humble with a physical Arduino robot navigating an 8x8 maze."
