# 🔧 Fixes Applied - System Synchronization

## Critical Issues Fixed

### ✅ 1. Robots Now AVOID Obstacles (Collision Detection)

**Problem**: Robots were moving into obstacles randomly.

**Fix**: 
- `backend/simulation_robot.py` - Modified `update_robot_exploration()` to:
  - Use **A* pathfinding** to navigate between positions
  - Check if target cells are obstacles before moving
  - Recalculate paths if obstacles are discovered blocking the route
  - Respect both `obstacles` and `blocked_paths`

**Result**: Robots now intelligently navigate around obstacles using A* algorithm.

```python
# Now robots use pathfinding:
path = find_astar_path(maze, current_pos, target_pos)
# And check for obstacles before moving:
if target in all_obstacles:
    robot.path = []  # Recalculate
```

### ✅ 2. Evacuation Paths ALWAYS Calculated and Displayed

**Problem**: Shortest paths weren't showing on frontend, not synced.

**Fix**:
- `backend/simulation_robot.py` - Modified `get_state()` to:
  - **ALWAYS** calculate evacuation paths for ALL humans
  - Calculate paths even if robots haven't detected humans yet
  - Include full path data in every state update
  - Ensure paths are in correct format `[[x, y], [x, y], ...]`

**Result**: Green lines now show from human position to exit immediately.

```python
# Evacuation paths calculated every frame:
for human_id, human_pos in self.maze.humans.items():
    best_path = find_astar_path(maze, human_pos, exit_pos)
    evacuation_plans[human_id] = {
        'evacuation_path': [list(p) for p in best_path],
        ...
    }
```

---

### ✅ 3. Dynamic Obstacle Detection & Path Updates

**Problem**: Obstacles weren't dynamic; paths didn't update.

**Fix**:
- Robots detect obstacles in real-time using `sense_obstacles()`
- When obstacle detected, `coordinator.robot_detected_obstacle()` is called
- Paths are recalculated immediately for affected humans
- Both `maze.obstacles` (static) and `maze.blocked_paths` (dynamic) are used

**Result**: System responds to new obstacles and recalculates paths dynamically.

---

### ✅ 4. Frontend Synchronization

**Problem**: Frontend showing random movements, not synced with backend logic.

**Fix**:
- Backend now provides comprehensive state every update (10 Hz)
- State includes:
  - Robot positions (with paths)
  - Human positions
  - **Evacuation paths** (always calculated)
  - Obstacles (static + dynamic)
  - Exits
  - Stats

**Flutter receives**:
```json
{
  "humans": [
    {
      "id": "human_1",
      "position": [3, 4],
      "evacuation_path": [[3,4], [2,4], [1,4], [0,4], [0,5], [0,6], [0,7]],
      "exit_target": [0, 7],
      "distance_to_exit": 7
    }
  ],
  ...
}
```

**Result**: Frontend displays exactly what backend calculates.

### ✅ 5. Gemini AI Integration & Voice Playback

**Problem**: AI messages not clear, voice not playing.

**Fix**:
- `backend/ai_coordinator.py` - Enhanced prompt to include:
  - Clear directional instructions (LEFT/RIGHT/UP/DOWN)
  - Exit information
  - Urgency level
  - Simple, spoken language

- **Auto-play audio**:
  - Added `_play_audio()` method
  - Uses `afplay` (macOS), `aplay` (Linux), `winsound` (Windows)
  - Plays audio automatically after generation
  - Background process (non-blocking)

**Result**: Clear voice guidance plays automatically every 10 seconds.

## System Flow (How It All Works Together)

### 1. Simulation Loop (10 Hz - 10 updates/second)
```
Every 0.1 seconds:
  → Robots sense environment
  → Detect obstacles → Add to blocked_paths
  → Detect humans → Register with coordinator
  → Robots use A* to navigate
  → Humans move along evacuation path (every 2s)
  → State packaged and sent to frontend
```

### 2. Pathfinding (A* Algorithm)
```
For each human:
  → Find shortest path to EACH exit
  → Pick exit with shortest distance
  → Calculate A* path avoiding obstacles
  → Return path as list of coordinates
```

### 3. AI Guidance (Every 10 seconds)
```
Every 10 seconds:
  → Collect maze state
  → Get evacuation plans
  → Gemini generates message:
     "Emergency! 1 person detected.
      Move LEFT 3 steps, then UP 4 steps to Exit A.
      Stay calm and move quickly."
  → Convert to speech (ElevenLabs)
  → Play audio automatically
  → Display in frontend
```

### 4. Frontend Display (5 Hz - updates every 200ms)
```
Every 200ms:
  → Poll /api/flutter-update
  → Get complete state
  → Draw 8x8 grid
  → Draw obstacles (black)
  → Draw exits (green)
  → Draw robots (red icons)
  → Draw humans (blue circles)
  → Draw evacuation paths (bold green lines)
  → Display AI guidance text
```

## Testing & Verification

### Run the System Test
```bash
./SYSTEM_TEST.sh
```

### Start Backend
```bash
cd backend
python3 main_server.py
```

**Watch for these logs:**
- `[robot_X] New path to (x, y): N steps` - Robot pathfinding working
- `[robot_X] Detected obstacle at (x, y)` - Obstacle detection working
- `[robot_X] Detected human_X at (x, y)` - Human detection working
- `👤 Human human_X moved from (x1,y1) → (x2,y2)` - Humans moving along paths
- `🎯 AI Guidance: ...` - AI analysis working
- `🔊 Playing audio: evacuation_guidance.mp3` - Audio playback working

### Start Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
flutter run -d macos    # For macOS
# OR
flutter run -d chrome   # For web
```

**Verify on frontend:**
- ✓ 8x8 grid visible and centered
- ✓ Robots (red) moving intelligently around obstacles
- ✓ Humans (blue circles) at positions
- ✓ **Bold green lines** from humans to exits
- ✓ Humans moving along green lines
- ✓ AI guidance text updating every 10s
- ✓ Audio playing (if ElevenLabs configured)

## Expected Behavior

### ✅ Robots
- Start at corners (0,0) and (7,0)
- Move using A* pathfinding
- **NEVER enter obstacle cells**
- Detect obstacles within 2-cell range
- Detect humans within 2-cell range
- Recalculate paths when obstacles discovered

### ✅ Humans
- Start at random position (one human)
- **Shortest evacuation path calculated immediately**
- **Green line shows path to nearest exit**
- Humans move 1 step every 2 seconds
- Follow calculated path exactly
- Reach exit and log "REACHED EXIT"

### ✅ Obstacles
- Static obstacles (black cells)
- Dynamic obstacles (discovered by robots)
- Both types block movement
- Paths recalculate when new obstacles found

### ✅ Paths (A* Algorithm)
- Always shortest valid path
- Avoid all obstacles
- Update when obstacles discovered
- Show as bold green lines on frontend
- Humans follow paths exactly

### ✅ AI & Voice
- Gemini analyzes every 10 seconds
- Clear directional instructions
- Audio generated (if API key set)
- Audio plays automatically
- Text displayed in frontend

## Common Issues & Solutions

### 🔴 "Robots entering obstacles"
**Solution**: Make sure you're running the UPDATED `simulation_robot.py`. Check logs for `[robot_X] New path to (x, y)` messages. If you see these, pathfinding is working.

### 🔴 "No green lines showing"
**Solution**: 
1. Check backend logs for `Paths: N` in status line
2. Open browser console (F12) and check network response from `/api/flutter-update`
3. Verify `evacuation_path` field exists in human objects

### 🔴 "No audio playing"
**Solution**:
1. Add ElevenLabs API key to `backend/.env`
2. Restart backend server
3. Check for `🔊 Playing audio:` in logs
4. On macOS, ensure `afplay` command works

### 🔴 "Frontend not updating"
**Solution**:
1. Verify backend running: `curl http://localhost:5001/health`
2. Check Flutter is connecting to `http://localhost:5001`
3. Check frontend console for errors

### 🔴 "Paths not recalculating"
**Solution**:
1. Dynamic obstacles are detected by robots
2. Robots need to be within 2 cells to detect
3. Check for `[robot_X] Detected obstacle` in logs

## API Keys Setup

### Gemini API (Text Analysis)
```bash
# backend/.env
GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyC6CirCpdSplp3mHD_bhN66J9FvlqnLQAU
```

### ElevenLabs API (Voice)
Get your key from: https://elevenlabs.io/

```bash
# backend/.env
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

**Without ElevenLabs**: System still works, just no audio. Text guidance still shown.
