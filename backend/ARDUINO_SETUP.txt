ARDUINO UNO SETUP - FINAL VERSION
===============================================

UPLOAD THIS FILE TO ARDUINO UNO:
---------------------------------
backend/arduino_robot_updated.ino


HOW TO UPLOAD:
--------------
1. Open Arduino IDE
2. File → Open → arduino_robot_updated.ino
3. Tools → Board → Arduino Uno
4. Tools → Port → Select your USB port
5. Click Upload (→)
6. Wait for "Done uploading"


WHAT THIS FILE DOES:
--------------------
✓ Listens to Serial commands
✓ Controls motors (forward, backward, left, right)
✓ Reads ultrasonic sensor
✓ Reads gyro (MPU6050)
✓ Works with WiFi (ESP32) or USB connection


COMMANDS IT UNDERSTANDS:
-------------------------
F,200,1000  → Forward (speed 200, 1 second)
B,150,1000  → Backward (speed 150, 1 second)
L,150,500   → Left (speed 150, 0.5 seconds)
R,150,500   → Right (speed 150, 0.5 seconds)
S           → Stop
U           → Read ultrasonic
G           → Read gyro


FOR WIFI:
---------
ESP32 receives WiFi commands → sends to Arduino via Serial

Your Python WiFi code (robot_controller.py) is CORRECT!
Just upload this .ino and it will work.


FOR USB:
--------
Use arduino_controller.py to control via USB directly


FOR ROS2:
---------
Use ros2_nodes/arduino_bridge_node.py
Connects Arduino Serial → ROS2 topics


===============================================
THAT'S IT! This is the ONLY Arduino file you need.
